Demonstration of how the Furhat audioFeed can be used

There are two examples in this repo:

* FurhatAudioFeedPlayback: Plays back the audio feed to computer's audio device

* FurhatAudioFeedRecorder: Records the audio feed to a wav file (recording.wav)

The IP address of Furhat is set to 127.0.0.1, please update this if you are running against a Furhat on another machine.

Don't forget to enable the audio feed on the robot.
